> _WARNING : To run succesfully you should have all the microservices running in your machine._

### Starting
Navigate to the notification microservice repository.

`cd YOUR_PATH/incidentes-atizapan/Backend/AuthService`

Install the dependencies

`npm install`

You will have to install a MongoDB server running in the port 27017, we are using the community edition, which you can insttal with this [guide](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community2)

To test your code use the command :

`npm run dev`

That is all!

## Deploying

Please look for the Backend Architecture to learn how it's going to be deployed. We are using Docekr conteiners for this purpose.
